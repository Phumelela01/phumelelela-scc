                <h2 class="heading-2">Our Story</h2>

                <h3 class="heading-3">How We Started</h3>
                <p>Phumelela Special Care Centre was established in response to the lack of suitable facilities for children with physical and mental challenges in Ezibeleni. Since 2005, we have provided daily care, education, and therapeutic support to learners who are often excluded from mainstream services. Our centre offers an inclusive, compassionate environment tailored to the needs of each child.</p>

                <!-- You mentioned Gogo, Zan, and another lady here; you can add a subsection or paragraph here to introduce them later -->

                <h3 class="heading-3">Our Background</h3>
                <p>The centre was initially housed in a shack at the old rent office with only three children. It moved to the Social Development building in 2007. Operating without its own funding, the centre relies on donations from the community, churches, and businesses. We provide two meals a day, currently serving 127 children. Unemployment and poverty remain significant challenges for many families.</p>
