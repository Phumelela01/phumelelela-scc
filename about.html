        <h3 class="heading-3">How We Started</h3>
        <p>Phumelela Special Care Centre is a non-profit organisation based in Ezibeleni, Queenstown, serving children and youth with diverse disabilities, including physical disabilities, intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), and complex support needs.

        <h3 class="heading-3">Our Backgound</h3>  
        <p>Since there were no suitable facilities for children with physical and mental challenges in Ezibeleni, Phumelela was established by a group of concerned parents. They identified that there was a need for proper care and stimulation for these children. They met in February 2005 to find ways of helping these children with disabilities. This initiative was welcomed by all. This initiative was, however, not sufficient since other families could not afford the running of the centre financially and there was a lack of resources. Unemployment and poverty are a major problem.</p>
        <p>The centre was previously housed in a shack at the old rent office with only three children. The centre moved to the Social Development building in 2007. The centre is operating with no funding of its own. It is depending on donations from the community, churches, and business sector. We provide two meals a day. This year we have 127 children.</p>
