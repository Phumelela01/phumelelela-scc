            <article>
              
                <p>Phumelela Special Care Centre is a non-profit organisation based in Ezibeleni, Queenstown. We serve children and youth with diverse disabilities, including intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), physical disabilities, and complex support needs. Since 2005, we have provided daily care, education, meals, and therapeutic support to learners who are often excluded from mainstream services. Our centre offers an inclusive, compassionate environment tailored to each child’s unique potential.</p>

                <p>Our mission is to establish a viable community-based centre to help all the people with disabilities at Ezibeleni Lukhanji Municipality and surrounding communities with appropriate skills and effective empowerment to make them independent and free from abuse and neglect.</p>

                <h3 class="heading-3">Vision</h3>
                <p>Our vision is to empower and improve social functioning and quality of life of the people with disabilities.</p>

                <h3 class="heading-3">History</h3>
                <p>Phumelela was founded in February 2005 by a group of concerned parents in Ezibeleni. They recognised the urgent need for proper care and support for children living with both physical and intellectual disabilities—needs that were not being met by existing facilities. <a href="phumelela-history.pdf" target="_blank" class="social-link">Read More</a> </p>
